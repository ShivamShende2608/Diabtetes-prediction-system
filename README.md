# DiabeTrack

This is a Diabetes Prediction System built using Django and Python that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user inputs.

## Introduction
DiabeTrack is a web-based application designed to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on input parameters from a dataset. The system uses machine learning models to analyze the input data and provides a result indicating either a positive or negative prediction for diabetes.

This project aims to assist in early detection of diabetes, enabling timely medical intervention and lifestyle changes to manage the condition effectively.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for inputting health parameters.
- Predicts diabetes based on a trained machine learning model.
- Displays results as positive (likely diabetic) or negative (not likely diabetic).
- Built using modern web technologies for seamless interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For backend development and implementing the machine learning model.
- **Django**: As the web framework for building the application.
- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating an appealing user interface.
- **PyCharm**: As the integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and managing code.

## Description
This is a Diabetes Prediction System built using Django and Python that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on user inputs.

## How It Works
1. Users input relevant health parameters (e.g., glucose level, BMI, age) through a web form.
2. The backend processes the input using a trained machine learning model.
3. The system predicts the likelihood of diabetes and displays the result as either positive or negative.
